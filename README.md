# Smart Parking Lot Management System

This project is a Parking Lot Management System built in Python that uses a **Linked List** to manage parked cars dynamically. The system allows for real-time entry and exit tracking of cars while efficiently handling capacity limits.

## Key Features

-   **Linked List Implementation**: Each car in the parking lot is stored as a node in a linked list for efficient management.
-   **Dynamic Allocation**: Cars are added and removed dynamically, simulating real-world parking behavior.
-   **Capacity Handling**: Prevents overflow by checking if the parking lot is full before allowing a new car to park.
-   **Entry & Exit Tracking**: Allows users to add (park) or remove (exit) cars using their unique license plate numbers.
-   **User-Friendly Menu**: A simple and intuitive text-based menu allows for easy interaction with the system.

## Use Case

This project serves as a practical demonstration of how data structures can be applied to simulate and solve real-world problems like parking lot management. It provides a solid foundation that can be extended with more advanced features, such as:

-   Automated slot assignment
-   Parking fee calculation based on time
-   Integration with a web or mobile application for a graphical user interface
